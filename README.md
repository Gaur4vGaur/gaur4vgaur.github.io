# India fights coronavirus

A dashboard to track the number of confirmed cases, recovered patients, and death tolls in India due to coronavirus.
The dashboard provides whole India and state wise analysis to better portray the threat. 

I am trying to spread awareness. Our government is doing a great job and I cannot expect a better response. But I feel:

1. Still data is staggered across. I am trying to put everything at a single place. I am trying
to make it easier to access data using sheet.

2. MoHFW is only reporting figures, which is not enogh for people to understand the
seriousness of the matter. Using the graphs/trends I am trying to draw attention on
why should people should take Corona-virus more seriously.
